Subject: prog lang discussion

Starting point: C, fix some obvious flaws, remove crud, add a few missing features
  - no includes, instead: import
  - no macros (do we need something instead?)
  - ideally only one file instead of a .h and .c file, module interface should be
    extracted automatically
  - statements: like in C, though should fix 'switch' statement
  - expressions: like in C, though with caveats (do we need ',' expressions?)
  - essentially strongly typed, but probably w/ support for runtime types
  - want arrays with bounds checking on always (except perhaps in 'unsafe mode'-see section on GC)
  - mechanism to hook up GC (I think that most code can live w/ GC, but for a true systems
    programming language there should be mode w/ full control over memory allocation)
  - support for interfaces (differentiate between concrete, or implementation types, and
    abstract, or interface types)
  - support for nested and anonymous functions/closures (don't pay if not used)
  - a simple compiler should be able to generate decent code
  - the various language mechanisms should result in predictable code
